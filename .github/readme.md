## Opinionated software

 - speed over beautiful code
 - human readable code over short variable names
 - own-code vs adding libraries
 - benchmarking over opinions (performance)
 - less clicks == better UX
 - user configurable options vs developer opinions


## WP-CLI commands

 - `wp wp2static options --help`
```

## Development 

This repo contains the latest code, which you can clone/download to get the bleeding edge, else install via the [official WordPress Plugin page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/)

If you'd like to contribute, please follow the usual GitHub procedures (create an Issue, fork repo, submit PR). If you're unsure about any of that, contact me and I'll be happy to help.

In trying to make development/contributing easier, we'll keep requirements to a minimum. If you prefer Docker, Local by FlyWheel, Valet, Bedrock, Linux, BSD, Mac, they're all fine. This is a WordPress plugin, so anywhere you can run WordPress, you can do development on this :)


### Localisation / translations

Localisation has fallen behind on this project. I welcome anyone who can contribute some expertise in this area / help me get the project easier to translate.

Our official [translation page](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/static-html-output-plugin) on wordpress.org.


## Support

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/leonstafford/wp2static/issues/new) here on GitHub or on the plugin's [support forum](https://forum.wp2static.com).

There is also a [Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/wp2static/shared_invite/enQtNDQ4MDM4MjkwNjEwLTVmN2I2MmU4ODI2MWRkNzM4ZGU3YWU4ZGVhMzgwZTc1MDE2OGNmYTFhOGMwM2U0ZTVlYTljYmM2Yjk2ODJlOTk), for quick discussions among the user community.

## Notes

When cloning the repo for direct use, clone it into a dir named after the official WP plugin's slug, `static-html-output-plugin`, this will make life easier.

## Sponsorship / supporting open-source

I'm committed (git-pun) to keeping this software open-source and free from selling out user data to a 3rd party. As of version 6, we'll no longer be using Freemius for this reason. We'll accept payments with Snipcart + Stripe, but they will have no knowledge of your WordPress website or any info not required for a payment. The only thing that tracks you on our marketing website is a YouTube embed, which I'll soon switch to an image to avoid that. I rock OpenBSD on my workstation and increasingly on servers because they are an open source project done very well.

There is no big company behind this software, besides a sole proprietership in my name, in order to comply with taxation requirements for me as an Australian resident.

Help keep me doing what I love: building and supporting this software.
