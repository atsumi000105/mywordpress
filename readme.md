# WordPress Static HTML Output

Allows you to leverage WordPress as a great CMS, but benefit from the speed, security and portability that a static website provides.

## Features

 - generates a standalone, static html copy of your whole WordPress website
 - specify extra files to include in the output (ie, dynamically loaded assets)
 - multi-language support (English/Japanese currently)

## Roadmap

 - selectively export only changed pages since last output
 - deploy your static files via sFTP, SCP, Dropbox, etc

## Development

This repo contains the latest code, which you can clone/download to get the bleeding edge, else install via the [official WordPress Plugin page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/)

If you'd like to contribute, please follow the usual GitHub procedures (create an Issue, fork repo, submit PR). If you're unsure about any of that, contact me and I'll be happy to help. 

## Support

Development is done in my personal time. If you would like to see some new features added, bugs fixed, etc, think about sending me a donation for motivation ;)
