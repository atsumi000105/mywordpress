<b>Initial crawl list</b>

<p>Before it starts to export your site, the plugin first generates a list of all WordPress URLs it thinks it should include. It takes these from what it knows about your posts, pages, tags, archives and media.</p>

<button class="button button-secondary">Preview initial crawl list</button>

<p>Where the plugin fails to detect certain URLs that you know you want to include, please add these in the Additional URLs field</p>

<p>Where the plugin has included too much and you want to exclude certain URLs, please add these URLs in the Exclude URLs</p>

                    <i>For a few themes, certain files may not be detected as part of the export process. Enter any such files here, one per line.

                    Enter them as the full URL, including your WordPress site url, ie:</i>
